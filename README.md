Raw data files are based on dyadic data and therefore cannot be shared openly. For this reason, scripts `0-Preprocessing.R` to `3-Variance decomposition.R` and `5-Descriptive correlations.R` won't run without access to these data sets.

Some shareable intermediate cached result files are located in `/cache`. 
Script `4-Reliability computation.R` can be partly run, as it accesses intermediate data objects stored in `cache/varDecomp.RData`.
